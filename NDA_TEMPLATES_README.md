# NDA Templates Guide

This folder contains professional Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) templates for use with consulting clients.

## Available Templates

### 1. **NDA_TEMPLATE.md** - Mutual NDA (Recommended for Most Cases)
- **Use when:** Both parties will be sharing confidential information
- **Best for:**
  - Long-term consulting engagements
  - Projects requiring deep collaboration
  - When you need to share proprietary tools/methods
  - Enterprise clients with complex requirements
- **Protection:** Protects both AydenAIT and the client

### 2. **NDA_ONE_WAY_TEMPLATE.md** - Simplified One-Way NDA
- **Use when:** Only the client is disclosing confidential information to you
- **Best for:**
  - Quick assessments or audits
  - Initial discovery phases
  - Simpler projects
  - Situations where you won't be sharing proprietary information
- **Protection:** Protects the client only

## When to Use an NDA

**✅ ALWAYS use an NDA for:**
- Enterprise consulting engagements
- Projects involving customer data or PII
- Access to client systems or infrastructure
- Discussions about proprietary business strategies
- Work with financial, healthcare, or regulated industries
- Projects involving trade secrets or competitive advantages

**⚠️ CONSIDER an NDA for:**
- Initial discovery/assessment calls with serious prospects
- Any discussion involving specific technical architectures
- Projects with startups discussing unreleased products

**❌ NOT typically needed for:**
- General sales conversations
- Public information discussions
- Open-source project collaborations
- Work already covered by Master Service Agreement (MSA)

## Implementation Workflow

### Before First Client Meeting:

1. **Prepare Template**
   - Choose appropriate template (Mutual vs One-Way)
   - Fill in client information
   - Review Purpose section
   - Adjust terms if needed (consult lawyer for major changes)

2. **Send for Review** (2-3 days before meeting)
   - Email PDF to client contact
   - Subject: "NDA for Review - [Project Name]"
   - Allow time for their legal team to review

3. **Sign and Execute**
   - Use digital signature platform (DocuSign, HelloSign, Adobe Sign)
   - Both parties sign before exchanging confidential information
   - Store executed copy securely

### During Project:

- Reference NDA in all project documentation
- Mark confidential materials appropriately
- Ensure team members are aware of obligations
- Track what information has been shared

### After Project:

- Note NDA expiration date (typically 5 years post-disclosure)
- Return/destroy confidential materials per agreement
- Maintain signed copy for full term + statute of limitations period

## Digital Signature Platforms

**Recommended Tools:**
- **DocuSign** - Industry standard, legally binding
- **HelloSign** - User-friendly, affordable
- **Adobe Sign** - Robust features, integrates with Adobe products
- **PandaDoc** - Good for bundling with proposals

## Customization Guidelines

### ✅ Safe to Customize:
- Company names and addresses
- Purpose/scope description
- Term length (typically 1-3 years for agreement, 3-7 years for confidentiality)
- Permitted disclosures list

### ⚠️ Consult Lawyer Before Changing:
- Definition of Confidential Information
- Exclusions from Confidential Information
- Remedies and enforcement provisions
- Governing law (especially for international clients)

### ❌ Never Remove:
- Mutual consideration language
- Exclusions for publicly available information
- Return of materials provisions
- Signature blocks

## International Clients

For clients outside Canada, consider:

1. **Governing Law:** May need to use client's jurisdiction
2. **GDPR Compliance:** Add data protection clauses for EU clients
3. **Language:** Provide translations for non-English speaking clients
4. **Cultural Considerations:** Some jurisdictions prefer shorter, simpler agreements

**Consult an attorney for international engagements.**

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I start work before NDA is signed?**
A: No. Never discuss confidential information before NDA is executed.

**Q: What if client wants to use their NDA template?**
A: Review carefully (or have lawyer review). Ensure it's mutual if you'll be sharing information too. Watch for overly broad non-compete clauses.

**Q: Do I need a new NDA for each project with the same client?**
A: Not if the original NDA is still in effect and covers the new project scope. Verify term hasn't expired.

**Q: What if client refuses to sign an NDA?**
A: Red flag. Either they don't value confidentiality, or the project doesn't involve confidential information. Assess risk carefully.

**Q: Can I use the same NDA for contractors/subcontractors?**
A: These templates are for you (consultant) and clients. Use a separate contractor NDA template if hiring subcontractors for client work.
